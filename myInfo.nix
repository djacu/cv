    summary = ''
      Seeking a full-time role in software engineering, signal processing, scientific data processing, or general analysis.
      I am passionate about creating clear, maintainable, and well tested code and reproducible systems and software.
      Experienced with large scale data processing.
      Experienced with creating production ready software for a variety of scientific algorithms.
      Looking to grow my data processing, application development, and functional programming skills.
      Experienced working in a remote environment and would prefer a remote based role but also willing to work in an office part time.
