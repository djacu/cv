# Examples

Use the navigation bar to see how you can use nixcv to create different sections.
Each example shows a full configuration (without the template) and the resulting outputs.

!!! note
    Each example has its own personal namespace (e.g. `nixcv.objective` for the Objective example.) so they cannot be merge directly.
